# Expectation-Maximization
Python Implementation of Expectation-Maximization Algorithm

// Implementation not yet completed

The numbers are distributed according to a mixture of two normally distributed mixture components.
Each number is drawn with equal probability p=0.5

Starting parameters for the given dataset are (mu_a, sigma_a) = (1, 1) and (mu_b, sigma_b) = (4, 1)
